*discription* Overview
This project is a basic Speech-to-Text (STT) system designed to transcribe short audio clips into readable text using pre-trained speech recognition models. It's built with Python and leverages libraries like speech_recognition and optionally Wav2Vec2 from Hugging Face.

🎯 Features
✅ Converts .wav audio files to text

✅ Uses Google Web Speech API via speech_recognition (free, online)

✅ Optionally integrates Wav2Vec2 for offline, deep learning-based transcription

✅ Modular and beginner-friendly Python implementation

✅ Suitable for voice-based applications, accessibility tools, or NLP preprocessing

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.8+

Libraries:

speech_recognition – simple, high-level STT interface

[pyaudio] – for real-time audio (optional)

[transformers, torchaudio] – for Wav2Vec2-based transcription

Tools: VS Code, optional FFmpeg for audio formatting

📁 How It Works
Load a short .wav file (must be PCM format)

Use speech_recognition to transcribe using the Google Web Speech API

Optionally, use Wav2Vec2 to run offline transcription with better accuracy

Output the transcription in the terminal or UI

📌 Use Cases
👨‍🏫 Voice note transcription for students or journalists

🔊 Accessibility tools for the hearing impaired

🧠 NLP pipelines for converting speech to analyzable text

🎙️ Audio documentation search or classification

🚀 Future Improvements
Add microphone support for real-time transcription

Add GUI with Streamlit or Tkinter

Improve accuracy with punctuation restoration and multi-language support

Deploy as a web API or integrate with mobile apps
